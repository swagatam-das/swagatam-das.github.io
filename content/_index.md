        My research focuses on developing theoretically grounded algorithms in:

        - Deep Learning and Representation Learning  
        - Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence  
        - Non-convex Optimization  
        - Statistical Learning Theory and Clustering  

        I am particularly interested in bridging rigorous statistical analysis with scalable machine learning systems.
